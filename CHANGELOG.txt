makefiles-2.5.1v2
-----------------
  * Moved module version numbers into a separate file, config/VersionList;
  * Rules for common operations are now based on templates in make/templates;
  * The top-level GNUmakefile now sets the path to include the work/bin directory and the mingw/bin directory;
  * add targets, mingw-download and mingw-unpack, to download and unpack the mingw compilers;
  * add path constraints so cygwin and dos pathnames will more closely match; if there is a problem, you'll
    get a message the first time you run make and it tries to generate your .configuration file;
  * As of wxPython 2.8.6.1, no patches are needed!
  * improved informational targets; type 'make' for help.
